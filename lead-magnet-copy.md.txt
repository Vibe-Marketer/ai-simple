Here’s the offer and page copy wired as one simple, insane event funnel.

## 1. The Offer (for you internally)

**Name:** Offer MBA + 728,000,000 Lead Vault  
**Positioning:** “Steal my offer brain and my lead universe in one shot.”  
**Includes (free for event attendees):**

1. **Offer MBA: The 7 AI Conversion Keys**
   - 7 linked GPTs that walk them through CORE → INTEL → MIND → RAW → EDGE → IDEA → POWER
   - Output: a single “Master Offer Playbook” Google Doc they can use for all copy, content, and outbound.

2. **728,000,000 Lead Vault**
   - Aggregated leads across LinkedIn, Instagram + key segments (homeowners, ecom, Skool owners, etc.).
   - Framed as: “The data spine you plug your new Offer MBA into to turn it into booked calls.”

3. **Bonus: The Direct Copywriter GPT**
   - Brutal audit + rewrite suggestions for pages, emails, posts.  
   - Framing: “It tells you where you’re weak, where you’re playing small, and forces this into money-generating assets.”

Primary CTA: **Get the Vault** (form submit)  
Secondary CTA: **Book an Implementation Call** (below + on TY page)

This is literally “one step of a multi-step solution” maxed out as a Grand Slam lead magnet. [$100M Leads, Page 33],[$100M Leads, Page 36]

### Section 2: What You’re Getting

**The Offer MBA: 7 AI Conversion Keys**

In about an hour, these 7 GPTs walk you step‑by‑step through:

- **CORE** – What you actually sell, how it works, who it’s for.  
- **INTEL** – Exactly who’s worth chasing (and who isn’t).  
- **MIND & RAW** – Their fears, desires, late‑night thoughts, and the language they actually use.  
- **EDGE & IDEA** – Why you win vs competitors and the unique mechanism that makes your offer uncopyable.  
- **POWER** – Hooks and angles that stop the scroll and force the click.

End result:  
**One Master Offer Playbook** you can hand to any writer, media buyer, or closer and say:  
“Use this. Don’t improvise.”

### Section 3: The 728,000,000 Lead Vault

Once your offer brain is built, I hand you the body:

- **728,000,000+ mapped leads** across LinkedIn, Instagram, and high‑intent segments (homeowners, ecom, Skool owners, and more).  
- Pre-built data you can search, filter, and deploy into outbound, retargeting, and content.

You’re not “building lists.”  
You’re deciding **who** you want and how fast you want to go.

### Section 4: Bonus – The Direct Copywriter GPT

Most people will download this and then procrastinate turning it into money.

That’s where this comes in.

**The Direct Copywriter** is my most used GPT. It:

- Tears apart your pages, emails, and posts with brutal honesty  
- Shows you exactly where you’re weak and where you’re leaving money on the table  
- Rebuilds it into punchy, conversion‑ready copy on demand

Drop in your Offer Playbook, paste whatever you’re working on, ask for posts, emails, or pages…  
and it **cranks out assets** until there’s nothing left to “think about,” only publish.

This is your execution engine.

### Section 5: Who This Is For

This is for:

- Founders, agencies, consultants, and operators who  
  - already sell something online  
  - want more booked calls / demos  
  - and are tired of “ideas” without infrastructure.

If you can close a call, I can make sure you never run out of people to talk to.

### Section 6: Implementation Call CTA

**Headline:**  
Want Us To Wire This Into Your Business For You?

**Copy:**  
If you don’t want another “cool download” sitting in Google Drive, we’ll help you turn this into a live system.

On a short Implementation Call, we will:

1. Look at your Offer MBA Playbook and current funnel  
2. Choose the fastest‑path segment from the 728M Lead Vault  
3. Map a 7‑day outbound + content sprint using your new assets

If it makes sense, we’ll show you what it looks like for us to build and/or run the system with you.
