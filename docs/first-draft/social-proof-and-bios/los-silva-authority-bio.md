# Conduct deep research on Los Silva and uncover all the social proof and credability that we would want to leverage in a site that's about scaling brands, ai, and offering systems/ai operations at scale.

Here is a distilled “social proof + credibility pack” for positioning Los Silva on a site about:

- Scaling brands
- AI systems
- Operations at scale / exits

Everything below is geared so you can plug directly into landing pages, sales decks, or VSL scripts.

***

## 1. Core Positioning: Who Is Los Silva?

**High‑authority positioning statement (for hero section):**

> Los Silva is a 20+ year entrepreneur, investor, and private equity operator who has helped hundreds of brands scale to 7, 8, and 9 figures, spent over \$100M on paid media, and advised on over \$300M in eCommerce exits. He now builds AI‑driven systems that run and scale businesses while founders sleep.[^1][^2][^3]

Key credibility anchors:

- 20+ years in digital marketing, e‑commerce, and brand building.[^4][^1]
- CEO/founder roles across agencies, accelerators, and private equity / rollup vehicles (SVG Media, PowerHouse Ventures/Brands, 528 Partners, DealFlow Brokerage, PrivateEquityGroup.com, Collective Commerce).[^5][^3][^1][^4]
- Recognized as one of the top DTC consultants in the USA and a “go‑to marketer” for scaling DTC brands and exits.[^3][^1][^5]

This gives you a clear “authority in scaling + exits + AI ops” headline to build around.

***

## 2. Track Record in Scaling Brands (DTC, eComm, Creators)

### a) Revenue \& ad spend proof

- Built and led an 8‑figure agency (SVG Media / PowerHouse ecosystem) with multiple 7‑figure sister companies in eCommerce and digital.[^6][^5]
- Has spent **over \$100M on advertising**, helping brands scale to 8‑ and 9‑figure sales.[^7][^3]
- Co‑founder of PowerHouse Ventures/PowerHouse Brands, a group that helps DTC and internet businesses double, triple, and quadruple revenue with the intent to sell, supported by a dedicated brokerage (DealFlow Brokerage). They work with investors and aggregators allocating tens of millions to brand acquisitions.[^2][^3]
- Advising and brokering **around \$300M worth of eCommerce companies in the exit pipeline**, typically in the 2–15M EBITDA range.[^2]

These numbers are the backbone of hard, quantifiable social proof for “scaling brands” and “exits.”

### b) Notable clients \& verticals

From interviews and features, Los is associated with or has worked with:

- Influencers \& experts: Heidi Powell, Thomas DeLauer, Josh Elizetxe, Ryan Moran, Kent Clothier, Justin Colby, Steve Weatherford, Ed O’Keefe, Raphael Vargas, and others.[^6][^3]
- Brands and companies: Know Foods, The Good Kitchen, Jawzrsize, various supplement and DTC lifestyle brands.[^3][^6]
- Earlier in his career, agency / BD work with major brands like Red Bull, Budweiser, Heineken, Ethan Allen, House of Blues, Walt Disney World, and more.[^8][^9]

This gives you a “wall of logos” opportunity (big CPG + influencers + DTC brands).

### c) Ecosystem \& offers for scaling brands

- **PowerHouse Brands / PowerHouse Ventures** – Mastermind and consulting group originally focused on eCommerce brands doing \$1M+ per year, helping them scale to 8 and 9 figures and prepare for exit. Later expanded to coaches, consultants, and service businesses as well.[^5][^2]
- **SVG Media** – Agency helping influencers and athletes build scalable companies and DTC brands.[^10][^11][^5]
- **Collective Commerce** – Strategy and innovation studio for established companies, helping build new digital products, experiences, and high‑growth revenue streams.[^1]

All of this supports a narrative like: “Los doesn’t just advise; he builds, scales, and exits brands in multiple verticals (DTC, info, services).”

***

## 3. Private Equity, Roll‑Ups, and Operational Exits

For a site that emphasizes systems/operations + AI + exits, his current PE focus matters a lot.

### a) 528 Partners \& home services roll‑ups

- **Co‑Founder \& CMO, 528 Partners** – A private equity firm focused on acquiring and scaling home service businesses, rolling them up, and exiting.[^4][^1]
- Specialized in **creative finance and no‑money‑down strategies** so owners can scale/acquire without heavy upfront capital – nice positioning for “systems, not just hustle.”[^1]


### b) DealFlow Brokerage \& PrivateEquityGroup.com

- Co‑founder of a brokerage (DealFlow Brokerage) tied to PowerHouse, helping facilitate exits for eCommerce and other online businesses.[^2]
- Launching and growing **PrivateEquityGroup.com** as a media + deal platform aimed at becoming the largest accredited investor newsletter in the U.S., focused on buying businesses and media assets (newsletters, podcasts, etc.).[^4]

This is strong cred that he’s not just a “marketing guy”; he’s operating in serious PE and roll‑up environments.

***

## 4. AI Systems \& Operations Credibility

This is where you want especially sharp proof for your AI/systems/ops site.

### a) “AI Council” – AI system that runs businesses

- In a detailed LinkedIn post, Los explains that he **built an AI system that runs businesses while he sleeps**, which he calls **“The AI Council”**.[^12]
- The Council is a coordinated system of specialized AI personas inside a single ChatGPT environment, each with a defined business function:
    - Nova – lead generation
    - Auren – systems/operations
    - Manus – prompt engineering
    - Inara – copywriting
    - Colt – sales
    - Kairos – strategy[^12]
- Example use case: He had an idea for an AI‑powered gym booking system. Within 45 minutes, the AI Council:
    - Outlined the lead gen strategy
    - Built the backend
    - Wrote all copy
    - Created sales scripts
so the business was “mapped, systemized, and ready to execute” before he finished his coffee.[^12]

This is exactly the kind of story you want for “AI systems and operations at scale” – an operational AI framework, not just AI copywriting.

### b) AI for removing operational complexity

- Another LinkedIn post describes how he used AI to **eliminate operational complexity** and restructure his companies. He frames “complexity as the silent killer” of growing businesses: too many tools, people, and moving parts killing margins and founder sanity.[^13]
- He describes building specialized AI agents that:
    - Recover **\$20K/month in late payments** automatically
    - Close deals from missed DMs
    - Run cold outreach with a **38% reply rate**
    - Handle client onboarding with **zero human touchpoints**[^13]

This gives quantitative proof that his AI implementations produce real operational gains (collections, sales, onboarding) – gold for copy.

### c) Systems \& SOPs as creativity enablers

- In another LinkedIn piece, he argues directly against the idea that SOPs kill creativity, saying **SOPs enable creativity at scale** and are essential in agencies/ops environments.[^14]

This connects his older “ops + systems” background to his new AI work: structure as a multiplier, not a constraint.

***

## 5. Earlier Operational \& Systems Experience (Non‑AI)

His credibility in systems didn’t start with AI – which strengthens the “ops pedigree” story.

- Early‑career role: **VP of Digital Marketing \& PR at NEC‑Integrated Solutions** – worked on integrated A/V and automation systems for residential and commercial spaces, including energy‑efficient systems, for clients ranging from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies.[^1]
- Ran a home theater / A/V distribution business that became the \#2 Bose audio distributor in North America before transitioning more fully into digital and eCommerce.[^15][^3]

This lets you frame him as someone who has been thinking in “systems” (automation, integration, efficiency) for decades, now applying that to AI.

***

## 6. Media Features, PR, and Thought Leadership

These are your “badges and logos” for the site.

### a) Major media and authority features

- Featured in **Entrepreneur (The Oracles)** – “Hustler and CEO Los Silva on Why Making an Impact Starts Right Now” – covering his role as CEO of SVG Media and builder of multi‑million‑dollar companies and seven‑figure launches.[^10]
- Recognized in **Business Journal**, **Under 30 CEOs**, **Mixergy**, **AppSumo**, **Merchee**, and others as an influential entrepreneur and brand builder.[^9][^1]
- Products and companies associated with Los have been seen on **TechCrunch, AppSumo, Mixergy, Rise to the Top, Entrepreneur on Fire**, and more.[^8]


### b) Podcasts and interviews (social proof + context for quotes)

You have a lot of podcast‑level social proof to leverage:

- **Beyond A Million – “Helping Scale 8 \& 9‑Figure Brands with Los Silva”** – covers \$100M+ in ad spend, hundreds of eCommerce/SaaS/Real Estate businesses helped, and building multiple agencies.[^3]
- **“9 Figures eCommerce Exits with Los Silva” (Adam Robinson)** – Los discusses working on **\$300M+ in eCommerce exits**, valuation frameworks, and how to build exit‑ready DTC brands.[^2]
- **Travis Chappell – “How to Start and Scale an Online Business”** – story of running an 8‑figure agency and multiple 7‑figure sister companies; positioning him as a “world‑renowned speaker” and “go‑to marketer” for scaling brands.[^6]
- **Derek Gehl – “Keys to eCommerce Success”** – positions Los as an eCommerce entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience.[^16][^15]
- **Ecommerce Uncensored – “Growing Your Brand Using Influencers”** – Los is brought on as an **expert on using influencers to grow brands**.[^17]
- Additional appearances: Secret Entourage “Secret Academy” episode, various entrepreneur and agency podcasts, etc.[^18][^19][^9]

Every one of these can be used for pull‑quotes and “As seen on” logos.

***

## 7. Platforms \& Audience Footprint

You can lean on his multi‑platform presence as soft credibility (especially for a “modern AI/brand” angle):

- **LinkedIn** – Active, with detailed posts on AI systems, the AI Council, SOPs, and operational scaling. His headline emphasizes:
> Recognized leader in scaling businesses and driving high‑value exits… Co‑Founder of 528 Partners… Co‑Founder of OnlineBusinessOwner.com… Partner at Sponsorships.com.[^1]
- **YouTube – “Los Hustle”** – Content around brand building, eCommerce growth, and scaling.[^20]
- **Instagram – @loshustle** – Bio: “Helping Biz Owners Scale and Exit. AI Systems for Growth \& Acquisition. Build a business you can SELL. DM ‘EXIT’.”[^21][^11]
- **X (Twitter) – @los_hustle** – Positioning as CEO of SVG Media and content around scaling eCommerce businesses.[^22]

This backs up a “he practices what he preaches with social/content systems” message.

***

## 8. “Social Proof Ready” Copy Blocks You Can Use

Below are ready‑to‑paste snippets for your site.

### a) Hero credibility block (scaling brands + AI + exits)

> Over the last 20 years, Los Silva has helped hundreds of eCommerce and DTC brands scale to 7, 8, and 9 figures, spent more than \$100,000,000 on paid advertising, and advised on over \$300,000,000 worth of eCommerce exits. Today, he builds AI‑powered systems that run entire businesses while founders sleep – from lead generation and sales to collections and client onboarding.[^13][^12][^3][^2][^1]

### b) Logos \& featured in

Use logos / mentions for:
Entrepreneur, Business Journal, Under 30 CEOs, Mixergy, AppSumo, TechCrunch, Rise to the Top, Entrepreneur on Fire, Beyond A Million, Travis Chappell, Adam Robinson, Derek Gehl, Ecommerce Uncensored, Secret Entourage, etc.[^9][^16][^17][^10][^8][^3][^2][^1]

### c) AI \& systems authority

> While most founders are still using AI to write blog posts, Los uses AI to engineer freedom. His proprietary “AI Council” – a coordinated system of specialized AI agents for lead generation, operations, copywriting, sales, and strategy – has replaced entire teams in his portfolio companies. These agents recover over \$20,000 a month in late payments, run cold outreach campaigns with 38% reply rates, and fully onboard new clients without a single human touchpoint.[^13][^12]

### d) “From brands to roll‑ups” angle

> Los doesn’t just scale brands – he buys, consolidates, and exits them. As Co‑Founder of 528 Partners, he acquires home service businesses, installs systems, and rolls them up for strategic exits. As co‑founder of DealFlow Brokerage and PrivateEquityGroup.com, he sits at the intersection of operators and capital, helping founders turn operational excellence into real liquidity.[^4][^2][^1]

## 9. How to Organize This on Your Site

For a site about scaling brands, AI, and systems/ops at scale, consider this structure:

1. **Hero Section**
    - Headline: “Scale, Systemize, and Sell Your Brand with AI‑Driven Operations”
    - Subheadline using the credibility snippet from Section 8a
    - Logos from media features and notable clients
2. **Section: The Operator Behind the Systems**
    - Short narrative: 20‑year entrepreneur, 8‑figure agency, \$100M+ ad spend, 300M in exits, DTC \& PE operator.[^5][^3][^2][^1]
    - Bullet list of major brands/influencers and big corporate clients.[^8][^9][^6]
3. **Section: AI Systems That Run the Business**
    - Story of the AI Council and concrete outcomes (collections, sales, onboarding, 45‑minute gym booking system).[^12][^13]
    - Emphasis that this is “synthetic specialist teams,” not single‑task bots.
4. **Section: Proven Brand Growth Frameworks**
    - PowerHouse Brands story: DTC accelerator, mastermind, and brokerage – scaling \$1M+ brands to 8–9 figures and exits.[^5][^3][^2]
    - Testimonials / case flavors from interviews (e.g., supplement brands, lifestyle apparel, subscription food brands).[^15][^3][^2]
5. **Section: Exits, PE, and Roll‑Ups**
    - 528 Partners, DealFlow Brokerage, PrivateEquityGroup.com – framing him as a systems‑driven acquirer, not just a marketer.[^4][^2][^1]
6. **Section: As Seen On \& Invited By**
    - Podcast/social proof grid (Beyond A Million, Travis Chappell, Adam Robinson, Derek Gehl, Ecommerce Uncensored, Secret Entourage, etc.).[^16][^17][^15][^6][^3][^2]

## 10. Gaps \& What You Might Add Manually

What is publicly available is very strong on:

- Experience and years in the game
- Big spend and big exit numbers
- AI systems stories with operational metrics
- Media features and interviews

What is less explicit publicly:

- Detailed written case studies with brand names + before/after metrics
- Direct on‑page testimonials with full names and titles (though client names exist in podcasts)

If you have private access to testimonials or screenshots ( Slack/WhatsApp, Looms, etc.), those will layer perfectly on top of this public proof stack.

***

If you like, next step can be:

- Drafting specific sections (hero, “About Los” strip, AI systems section) in your brand voice, or
- Turning this into a one‑pager credential deck for sales calls and partnership pitches.
