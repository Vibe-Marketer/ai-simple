Pick the **first one** (red / black creative agency layout).

Here’s why and exactly how to bend it to your will.

---

## Why Template #1

1. **It already looks like a “boutique operator studio,” not a SaaS app.**  
   You and Los are the product. Template #1 is built to showcase people, work, and outcomes. The others scream “fintech SaaS” or “crypto protocol,” which fights your positioning.

2. **Card layout = perfect for case studies + authority.**  
   Those 3–4 cards under the hero? That’s where you show:  
   - “$XM in revenue unlocked”  
   - “XX,XXX leads generated”  
   - “Top brands we’ve helped”  
   Instantly feels like a proven shop, not a dude with prompts.

3. **Dark, premium aesthetic without the ‘AI gradient vomit’ vibe.**  
   It reads as design-forward and expensive, not “I used a free AI page builder.”

## How to repurpose it for “You + Los”

### Hero

Replace the current hero with:

- Big headline:  
  **Build Offers, Brands & AI Systems That Actually Move the Needle**

- Subhead:  
  “Work directly with Los Silva and [Your Name] to architect offers, content machines, and AI-driven systems that turn attention into revenue.”

- Two CTAs:  
  - **Work With Us** (scrolls to a consulting section / Typeform)  
  - **Get Our AI Lead Vault** (goes to your Offer MBA + 728M leads page)

Side‑by‑side photos of you and Los or a single strong shot together.

### The 3 main cards under hero

Use them like this:

1. **“Offer Architecture”**  
   Short copy: “We build Grand Slam offers, positioning, and pricing that make your market feel stupid saying no.”

2. **“Brand & Content Systems”**  
   “We install a repeatable content + social system that compounds attention and authority.”

3. **“AI & Automation in the Business”**  
   “We implement workflows that turn calls, content, and ops into repeatable systems with AI.”

Optional 4th card: **“Private Founder Advisory”** for your coaching / consulting.

---

### Stats / proof section

Swap their generic stats for your concrete bragging rights:

- `+$XM` in client revenue influenced  
- `XX,XXX+` leads / calls booked  
- `X` industries / markets  
- `Y` years operating online

Below that: logos of brands / platforms / podcasts (Acquisition.com, YouTube subs, shows Los has been on, etc.)

---

### “Projects / Case studies” strip

Turn this into 3–6 **mini case studies**:

- “Scaled [Brand] from X → Y followers and Z booked calls in 90 days.”  
- “Rebuilt [Offer] -> 3x close rate without more traffic.”  

Each card: result in the title, one‑liner on how, CTA: **See Breakdown** (could open a simple Notion or stay static for now).

---

### Pricing section

You can either:

- Keep a **single “Engage Us” tier** with “Apply to work with us” button,  
  or  
- Remove pricing entirely and use it as a “How we work” visual (Strategy Day → 90‑Day Build → Long‑Term Advisory).

Main CTA in this section: **Apply for a Strategy Call**.

---

### Global “Lead Magnet” button

In the header, add one standout button:

**“Free Offer MBA + 728M Leads”**  
→ Links straight to your event / lead magnet page.

That keeps the credibility site doing its job (authority) while quietly feeding the funnel.

Execute order:

1. Choose Template #1.  
2. Swap hero + nav + buttons to match above.  
3. Replace inner sections with proof, case studies, and your core 3–4 services.  
4. Add the global AI Lead Vault button.

You don’t need it perfect; you need it live before the event. Pretty can happen on iteration 2.
