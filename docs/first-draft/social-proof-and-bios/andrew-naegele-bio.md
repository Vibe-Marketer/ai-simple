# **Andrew Naegele**  **\[Pronounced Nay-gull\]**

**Founder of CallVault**

Founder and Visionary behind CallVault — The AI-Powered Knowledge Vault and Source of Truth for Call-Driven Businesses. 

Entrepreneur, Copywriter, AI Strategist, and Author of Shit Happens: How to Laugh While Life Kicks Your Ass

Andrew Naegele is the founder and creator of the “Offer MBA”, the Multiplied Leverage Principle, and CallVault, the first AI-powered knowledge vault built for execution-first entrepreneurs. He has helped and consulted for a number of 9-figure and 8-figure founders to engineer scalable offers, create instant marketing campaigns, and solve complex problems with innovative and unique solutions. His frameworks in buyer psychology, multiplied leverage, and persuasive communication have been used by founders, agencies, and coaches to generate millions in sales.

He is known for turning chaos into structure — using AI in unique and innovative ways not previously considered by others, for creating systems that extract hidden buyer intelligence, launching complete conversion-ready funnels in under seven minutes, and for freeing other visionaries from the drag of complexity and being the bottleneck in their business.

Andrew’s story is one of brutal reinvention. After walking away from a burned-out 7-figure business overnight, he rebuilt from nothing, leveraging AI and automation to save his marriage, lose over 100 pounds in just 260 days, and create a new path forward. That journey ultimately birthed CallVault, a platform and philosophy for building businesses — and lives — that scale without breaking their founders.

He’s spoken on stages and worked closely with industry leaders like Jon Benson, Anik Singal, Andrew Kroeze, and Los Silva, and has built systems trusted by top coaches, marketers, and info brands. His personal mission is to help small, scrappy teams unlock compound leverage by removing technical roadblocks and installing AI-driven execution systems. Making it so the “little guys” can get back to their dream of being a CEO and Founder of a rapidly scaling brand instead of being stuck in the rut of being a full-time marketer and slave to their business.
