# knowing everything that you know about me and what I'm doing/building and everything that I've done.. the people Iv'e worked with,etc. do deep research on Andrew Naegele and uncover all the social proof and credability that we would want to leverage in a site that's about scaling brands, ai, and offering systems/ai operations at scale.

Based on my comprehensive research, here's the social proof and credibility positioning for Andrew Naegele focused on scaling brands, AI, and operational systems:

## Elite Network \& Endorsements

Andrew Naegele has worked directly with multiple 8 and 9-figure entrepreneurs who've publicly endorsed his expertise. **Anik Singal** (founder of Lurn \& Complily, \$200M+ in online sales) called him "by far the BEST AI EXPERT I've had a chance to talk to" and "the very FIRST person that I now not WALK, but RUN to for AI advice". Singal specifically noted that Andrew solved "some of the toughest AI problems in our company" in under 24 hours—work that would have taken his internal team weeks.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

**Los Silva**, an investor, mentor, and advisor to 7-figure+ businesses, described Andrew as "the monstrosity here on AI by leaps and bounds" and stated "I don't think there's many people out there that can top Andrew". Other high-profile clients include **Jon Benson** (Andrew redesigned the UI/UX for BNSN), **Chris Daigle**, and **Jay Feldman**.[^5][^4][^1]

## Proven Track Record \& Case Studies

Andrew's documented results demonstrate his ability to scale operations through AI and systems:[^1]

## Authority \& Credentials

He's the founder of "CALLVAULT AI" (insert info on callvault here)

He's the **Founder of the VibeOS**, the platform is still in development but is positioned as "the end of marketing tools" by delivering outcomes instead of requiring users to become tech experts.[^7][^1]

## Operational Excellence

Andrew's background demonstrates mastery of both brick-and-mortar and digital operations:[^1]

- **Founder of 7x Systems** (May 2024-present): AI consulting, Vibe Coding, and building AI businesses[^1]
- **COO at Lead Gen Jay** (June 2024-October 2025): Scaled operations for automated lead generation and cold email systems[^1]

- **Founder of IFIX Enterprises** (October 2019-January 2024): one of only a handful of 7-figure single location cell-phone sales and service businesses in the US and #1 T-Mobile TPR location in the US. 


## Weekly Live Implementation Model

Through **The Vibe Marketing** community on Skool, Andrew conducts weekly live implementation sprints where they identify clients' biggest bottlenecks and build AI employees to handle them—deployed during the call. This demonstrates his ability to deliver immediate, practical results rather than theoretical frameworks. Andrew and his programs are endorsed by industry leaders and has worked with influencers totaling over 6 million followers combined.[^7]

## Thought Leadership \& Content

Andrew has authored the **7-Minute AI Advantage™** (soon to be released) and runs weekly Friday sessions deconstructing "what's working right now in AI, automation, and outbound—live, no paywall, no fluff". His positioning emphasizes "clarity beats complexity, every time".[^1]

## Key Positioning Statements

His unique positioning includes:[^1]

- "I build engines. For the last decade I've been obsessed with stripping away everything that slows revenue"
- Specializes in "completely AI-powered prospecting systems" that book meetings on autopilot, multiply LTV without hiring armies of SDRs, and replace bloated tech stacks with lean, no-code toolkits[^1]
- "The AI Architect that 8 and 9-figure founders call when they need real AI solutions"[^7]

This combination of elite client endorsements, proven revenue results, technical expertise, and live implementation methodology positions Andrew as the go-to expert for scaling brands through AI-powered operational systems.
