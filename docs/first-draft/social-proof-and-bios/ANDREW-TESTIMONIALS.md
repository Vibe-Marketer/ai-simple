@Andrew Naegele just wanted to give a huge thank-you for the confidence push you gave me\! I posted one LinkedIn update and, 36 hours later, closed a $19,000 build-out. I'm doing 30% off my $30k package for the first 5 clients...and now I have many companies saying they want to be part of the first five\! 🎉

Today marks 1 week I’ve been a member. I was in the free Skool for a few weeks and decided to jump on the call Friday. I was astonished at how much value attendees got from Andrew’s instruction. He helped people with offers, funnels, copy, productivity, AI… all of it. 

I said to myself, “I could bring any challenges to this call and get expert help, free?” I wondered what the catch was because I wasn’t yet a member. I was impressed. 

After attending a second call, I was invited to join. @Andrew Naegele delivering so much value made my decision a no-brainer. I am completely floored by the value. I’m grateful Andrew provides such a broad level of support.

I finally understood how to leverage AI to create perfect cold email copy. The way you combined Grok, Perplexity, and Claude to uncover research-based insights and pain points was incredible to watch. That approach completely changed my game \- I now use it for everything\!

I’m so grateful for these calls. They’ve cleared every hurdle I had along the way, and now I feel completely ready to launch today\! I was honestly lost with all the new automations and tools dropping every few minutes \- I didn’t know where to focus my attention. Your guidance kept me aligned with what actually matters. Thank you for that\!

Whenever you solve someone’s problem, there’s always incredible learning behind it. The way you explained using Lovable and other AI tools was pure gold\! You’ve truly been super helpful for everything \- from small hiccups with email verification and warming mails to helping me craft the perfect copy. It’s been an amazing experience. \#GOAT 🙌💯

There are two major things I’ve accomplished in the past 2–3 months through these calls with Andrew. I rebuilt my website using platforms like Lovable, I’m now able to prepare case studies and proposals in under an hour. I improved my copywriting for the second and third steps in my sales process, something I had struggled with since starting. Now I’m reactivating old leads effectively \+ I’m also building my AI-powered reply system.

Because of the AI Automations private group and diving deep into stuff that you’re up to, many SOPs that I’ve been needing to get done for close to a year are now complete, and I just finished writing a powerful lead magnet/book that I’ve been debating on for close to a quarter, over a weekend. @Andrew Naegele you’re the GOAT in my eyes my man.

These calls have been invaluable in cutting through the noise. These sessions help me know what to focus on and how to act on it. I’ve already made progress—sorted out my inbox setup and quickly spun up my website using lovable.dev. 

Beyond just answers to my own questions, hearing others’ challenges and his feedback on them has helped broaden my thinking and strategy. Please keep them going. Thank you @Andrew Naegele\!

Being on the Calls I’ve become a better business owner by really focusing on my offer, I’ve been able to provide value to someone upfront without expectation of reciprocity. Funny enough I’m on track to have a $5k week pushing for my first $10k month\! I’ve become more comfortable with AI tools, my tool I created in Lovable is actually getting completed this month and entered in a contest. You’ve helped me tremendously…

The biggest thing I’ve gained is confidence to have an idea and just do it. Sell the idea first and figure the rest out along the way. Watching you vibe code an app that you sold to a high-ticket client was truly inspiring. In fact, I opened a lovable account and did the same thing. I didn’t expect that from a casual Friday call.

Andrew has been extremely valuable to my company and has played a key role in figuring out and really dialing in my lead generation platform. He’s gone the extra mile to provide valuable insight and information. I wouldn’t have achieved such progress in such a short time without his generous sharing of experience. I highly recommend Andrew. I can confirm that without his guidance and our weekly meetings, I wouldn’t have been able to scale so quickly. I was able to avoid most of the growing pains. • David Han—Cornerstone Capital

Before I started working with Andrew, I was stuck. Too many ideas, no clear direction. I kept thinking, “I’ll launch soon,” but I never did. I was building pieces instead of real results.

What really stood out was how simple he made it. No fancy words. No long-winded plans. Just: What’s the problem? Here’s how we fix it. He gave me structure and called me out when I made it harder than it needed to be.

One of the biggest shifts? I stopped waiting. I stopped tinkering. I started pushing buttons and building. I didn’t need more time—I needed to move. That’s what changed.

Because of that, I finally launched what I’d been sitting on for months. I closed deals. I got clarity. I stopped bouncing from idea to idea.

Now, I take action every day. I know what I’m building, who it’s for, and how it works. No second-guessing. No watching other people win.

If you’re thinking about working with Andrew, stop thinking. Start doing. If you wake up with plans and go to bed with excuses, this will fix it. He doesn’t teach theory. He builds momentum.

Andrew, this is impressive as hell. I’m curious if you know this was the vision I had for Improver. We put Improver on the back-burner due to all the BNSN and BMS stuff, but I’m circling back to it now.

Interested in possibly doing something together on this? I don’t know what that would look like, but since I’ve been needing my IP into Improver for a while now, it may be worth exploring.

I’ve been meaning to share this because the impact you’ve had on my journey deserves serious recognition. Here are my top wins:

You took the time to walk me through my copy and helped refine the messaging inside my Skool community. Because of your guidance, I received 5 strong responses, gained a new customer from Skool, and brought in $23,000 to date as a direct result.

I’m getting better at using AI and have been blown away by how effectively you leverage it in your business.

I’ve started using automation platforms like Make.com and Boost.space. I now have three solid automations running, which are helping my VAs create content much faster and more efficiently.

I use three of your custom GPTs almost daily—for cold emails and standard responses. They’ve saved me 2-3 hours a week, and my copy is sharper, more consistent, and feels much more aligned with my voice.

Thank you again for all the insight and support. It’s made a real difference in how I operate and scale\!\! • Phil

So pumped\! I truly am looking forward to skyrocket my business (or businesses) with your help and guidance @Andrew Naegele. I’ve never met a mentor who’s going above and beyond. ❤️ thank youuuu. Let’s gooo\!\!\!\!

I’ve been using @Andrew Naegele AI tool, \[OfferOS\] "Product | Target Market \- BuildABuyer Prompt/GPT," to build customer ICPs, customer GHL builds, emails, sms, social media posts, websites, funnels, competitive edges, buyer personas, pain points, desired outcomes, VLSs, unique mechanisms, differential mechanisms, power market statements, and more.

I can’t recommend it enough. This tool should be a High Ticket offer, and it should be mandatory for anyone who needs customer insights.

It’s been a game-changer—cutting my website building time in half, and the number of revisions needed is almost zero. I compare it to having a team of 4–8 marketers conducting target market research for six months, but completing it in just two hours. No one in the market offers this level of build, to my knowledge.

I’m currently working on a GHL intake form to collect all the necessary information upfront, allowing me to take the customer through the process with minimal involvement from them. 

This system, built by Andrew, has easily 10x’d my quality, effort, and delivery speed. After the intake form, I expect to be able to produce these outputs in less than an hour. With customer involvement, it takes about two hours.

If I am quiet or absent from the weekly calls, it is only because I am spending the time taking massive action and focusing on what will move the needle the most. Been working on Lovable after spending several hours digesting all the documents on copy and positioning. I should have the first website done by Monday as I am getting more comfortable with using Lovable.

Rob Rando · 2d · Shout Out\!\!\! 📢

So much value here \- Shoutout to Andrew

I’ve been here for 2 weeks now. Have an offer, target market and writing email sequences while accounts are warming.There is definitely a learning curve which tells me how valuable learning this stuff is.

Anyway, the point of this post is to shout out @Andrew Naegele for the “Unlimited Leads 100% FREE\!” scraper video.

Extracted from Live Calls

Patrick Ampem: “Andrew is, like, just amazing. Honestly, the knowledge, his expertise is just phenomenal. He’s genuine. He’s more than a lot of the big names you hear about—he’s the guy. He’s the diamond in the rough. When you find a diamond, you hang on to him. We trust him. We love him. He’s a brother.”

Patrick Ampem: “Even before our machine was up and going, we came to the calls just to get a feel for the community. Every time we come here, we learn something. It’s worth coming whenever we can with Andrew. This is why I hate missing calls.”

Patrick Ampem: “Andrew is the real deal—every bit, he’s over 200%. He’s a complete finisher, more of everything. We trust him, no matter what.”

Sean Ingram: “Most times when you engage with people, the output you get never matches the idea in your head. With Andrew, it takes things to a whole new level you weren’t even going to go to—and might never have gotten there without him.”

Sean Ingram: “Andrew’s the master of the negative prompt.” (humorous, but shows credibility in AI/copy expertise)

Sean Ingram: “This is exactly what I needed and didn’t even know it.”

Bernardo Olivas: “This is crazy. This is what it’s like all the time.” (in response to your teaching)

Bernardo Olivas: “What you just showed—insane. The amount of output in seconds is really good.”

Bernardo Olivas: “I saw one of your older videos where you summarized all the Fathom recordings to get ICP pain points. I thought that was insane.”

Eddy Bautista: “Andrew, I’m mind blown. Honestly, when I joined, I didn’t think there was going to be this much value. I thought it would be laid back, and I’m mind blown. The knowledge is insane. The coaching calls make it valuable, not just the course.” 

Eddy Bautista: “Andrew always has value. They should have sold us on Andrew. The community is great, but Andrew’s coaching calls are what make this worth it.”

Eddy Bautista: “I’m usually the one talking in masterminds, but here I’m quiet because I’m taking in so much. That’s why I joined—to be in a room with people like Andrew who are next level.”

"MarketingOS | Planning \- 09/01/25"

Kay (Kofi’s Partner): "We implemented the making sure that every time that we use has a double effect, so we've got almost all our SOPs done now in just a week, because as we work, we're documenting, and it's been a game changer for us. We have, I think, 15 more SOPs to get done, and it's not even the end of September. We've gone through like 45, so that was our biggest win last week..."

Extracted from Actual Testimonial Videos

Anik Singal: "If you are looking for a true AI expert. Now I'm not talking about how everyone and their grandmother lately is an AI expert. I'm not talking about someone who just goes to ChatGPT and writes a prompt. I'm talking about someone who actually understands all of the different layers of technology that exist around AI and how to get AI to do things, not only better, but to do some of the more complicated tasks of AI."

Anik Singal: "Some of the toughest AI things that we had to do in our company, we were stuck and we were making some progress. But then what we brought Andrew in, I mean, we're talking about having gotten something that would have taken my team weeks. He did it in less than a day." (Anik Singal’s comment here.. This demolishes the competition. The “weeks” to “a day” transformation hits different)

Anik Singal: "It is very rare that I make endorsement videos like this, and it's even more rare for me to make such a strong endorsement. I'm telling you right now, Andrew is absolutely by far the best AI expert I've had a chance to talk to. And I talk to people every day." (Anik Singal's typical reluctance to make endorsements makes this hit harder.)

Los Silva: "Andrew’s a prompt engineer. I think it will be a position in people's business. Andrew's a partner in some of our companies now, because of the level of efficiency and the lack of people that are necessary, because we have one person that knows how to talk to infinite outsourcers."

Kevin Mabry: "Bar none, one of the best people that I've worked with that really understands what he's doing when it comes to all the tools and code email and AI and the things that you might need internally in your business, he's helped me to grow and to expand and gain a lot of knowledge."

Jake Longwood: "He doesn't BS. He doesn't sugarcoat. He just tells me like it is exactly what I need to hear. If you're looking for a coach, hire Andrew, he's the guy. Stop looking."

Osaro: "I met Andrew in August when I was at a point in my life where I had no idea what I was doing. Like no idea about how I taught my lead generation agency, and I felt so alone, so scared. And then I joined Andrew's community... not too long after I got my very first client."

Here are the knockout testimonials that actually move the needle:

The Authority Builders:

Anik Singal: "I'm talking about someone who actually understands all of the different layers of technology that exist around AI and how to get AI to do things, not only better, but to do some of the more complicated tasks of AI" (Anik separates you from the ChatGPT tourists.)

The Efficiency Bomb:

Anik Singal: "He understands how the technical side of AI works. So how to layer prompts, how to prompt chain, how to use an LLM with a machine learning aspect of it. I mean, when he starts talking, my mind is just absolutely blown."

Anik Singal: "Every company that's not deploying and using AI is going to be left behind here in a matter of just months, if not maybe a year or two."

Anik Singal: "In all of these situations, the very first person that I now not walk to, but run to for advice and for counsel and for consult is Andrew."

Ty Leon Genaro: "I've signed up for a lot of different communities, digital marketing, different courses, programs, and I've got to say this program over delivers. Andrew stays on late, goes way past making sure that questions are answered, making sure that things are very thorough and then just always over delivers."

Ty Leon Genaro: "This is the community to be in for digital marketing."

Los Silva: "Andrew's the monstrosity here on AI by leaps and bounds."

Los Silva: "Andrew is a prompt engineer. I think it will be a position in people's business." \- Los Silva positions you as creating an entirely new executive role.

Los Silva: "Andrew's a partner in some of our companies now, because of the level of efficiency and the lack of people that are necessary, because we have one person that knows how to talk to infinite outsourcers, if you think of it. So he's managing a team of infinite outsourcing because he knows how to speak to that." The Partnership Proof: Los Silva positions this as they’re not just hiring you. They're making you a partner. That's conviction with equity.

Los Silva: "I don't think there's many people that can even touch Andrew when it comes to AI."

Kevin Mabry: "He's great with communication and helping you get from one point to the other. I cannot tell you enough good stuff about him."

Mubbu \- Wiz of Ecom: "I've never seen an individual as smart as Andrew when it comes to AI. This guy has GPTs after GPTs created and we're working with him side by side to innovate. To be a company that no one else has seen."

Mubbu \- Wiz of Ecom: "I can't believe how efficient our work's going to be."

Jake Lockwood: "When I make a call with him, I know that I'm getting maximum value."

Jake Lockwood: "I look forward to many, many more great coaching calls with you. You're the best."

Robert Medina: "Not only is he very knowledgeable with all the strategies and technical aspects of business. He's also big into all the things that in my opinion really limits us as entrepreneurs and business owners, which is all the ‘psychological’… the mental aspect of the game."

Robert Medina: "I can tell that every single conversation that Andrew is just so prepared for every single type of question, whether it's technical or sales or prospecting or mental or limiting belief."

Robert Medina: "If you have the opportunity of working with him, I promise you it's going to be one of the best decisions taken in a long time. For your business, but more than anything for yourself."

Osaro: "Andrew literally showed me what it feels to have a mentor that is more like a father figure."

Osaro: "He truly held my hand and guided me and not too long after I got my very first client."

Osaro: "Meeting Andrew, I believe is one of the biggest blessings I've achieved this year. It's one of the biggest blessings that God has given me this year."

Osaro: "Andrew's community is more than $10,000 in value to me because I know that getting Andrew to look at my work personally and invest so much time, effort, and emotions in my success, if I had to pay that elsewhere, I would definitely pay over 10,000 bucks."

Osaro: "He's awesome. He's such an amazing person. He's so kind. He's so loving. He's so real. He's so genuine, and he's someone that's extremely invested in you as a person when you come in contact with him."

Osaro: "Honestly speaking, Andrew is the real deal."

\#\# Testimonials:

Michael Holmstadt: 

"I ran a couple of scenarios... I took call transcripts from companies I'm working with, fed the transcript into \[the software\], and it's like magic, man. It's worth the price of admission. It's a no-brainer."

Patty Dominguez: 

"I just really want to acknowledge you because the way that you operate is so honest and refreshing. Where your heart's at, you really want us to win, and I definitely appreciate that. I've been in other super high-ticket groups with a lot of empty promises and under-delivery. I really see you as an outlier because everybody else is super hypey... but that's definitely not you guys."

Willie Dochee:

"I'm new to all of this and don't have the business or the experience. But being in here, I feel comfortable. It makes me feel like I can make it here, that it's something I can actually do because of you and the community. To be one of the founders, I was all in. I decided not to buy the new BMW and put my money here instead. And I love it."

\#\#\# Positive Statements
