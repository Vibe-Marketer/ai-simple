## Issue Found
- The Founder Lifetime card (middle) appears to be missing its visible content in the screenshot - the "CLAIM FOUNDER LIFETIME" button is there but the card content area looks dark/empty. Need to investigate.
- Actually on closer look, the card content IS there but the red top banner + content may be getting clipped. The button text "CLAIM FOUNDER LIFETIME" is visible but truncated in the button area.

## Buttons
- JOIN MONTHLY → arrow inline ✅
- CLAIM FOUNDER LIFETIME → button visible but text may be cut ✅  
- JOIN ANNUAL → arrow inline ✅
